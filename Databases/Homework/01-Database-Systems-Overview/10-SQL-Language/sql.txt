SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system.
Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language.
SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
For example:
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database -> SELECT * FROM table_name;
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion -> SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value;
The INSERT statement is used to populate the table with a few rows -> INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (valueOne, valueTwo);
