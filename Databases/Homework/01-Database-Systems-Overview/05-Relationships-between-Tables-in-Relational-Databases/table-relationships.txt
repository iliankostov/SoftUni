Relationships between tables are based on interconnections - primary key / foreign key. There are several types:
- One-to-one: Both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value relates to only one (or no) record in the related table. Most one-to-one relationships are forced by business rules and don't flow naturally from the data. In the absence of such a rule, you can usually combine both tables into one table without breaking any normalization rules.
- One-to-many: The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one, or many records in the related table.
- Many-to-many: Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table. Many-to-many relationships require a third table, known as an associate or linking table, because relational systems can't directly accommodate the relationship.
