Before one can start to implement the database tables, one must define the integrity constraints. Integrity means something like 'be right' and consistent. The data in a database must be right and in good condition. There are the domain integrity, the entity integrity, the referential integrity and the foreign key integrity constraints.
- domain integrity means the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. You define: data type; length or size; is null value allowed; is the value unique or not for an attribute. You may also define the default value, the range (values in between) and/or specific values for the attribute. Some DBMS allow you to define the output format and/or input mask for the attribute. These definitions ensure that a specific attribute will have a right and proper value in the database.
- entity integrity constraint states that primary keys can't be null. There must be a proper value in the primary key field. This is because the primary key value is used to identify individual rows in a table. If there were null values for primary keys, it would mean that we could not identify those rows. The entity integrity constraints assure that a specific row in a table can be identified.
- referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables and it is used to maintain the consistency among rows between the two tables. The rules are:
1. You can't delete a record from a primary table if matching records exist in a related table.
2. You can't change a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
3. You can't enter a value in the foreign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
4. However, you can enter a Null value in the foreign key, specifying that the records are unrelated.
- foreign key integrity constraint. There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade delete related rows. These constraints affect the referential integrity constraint.
1. Cascade Update Related Fields - any time you change the primary key of a row in the primary table, the foreign key values are updated in the matching rows in the related table. This constraint overrules rule 2 in the referential integrity constraints. 
2. Cascade Delete Related Rows - any time you delete a row in the primary table, the matching rows are automatically deleted in the related table. This constraint overrules rule 1 in the referential integrity constraints.
