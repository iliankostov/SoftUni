C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET. The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.
