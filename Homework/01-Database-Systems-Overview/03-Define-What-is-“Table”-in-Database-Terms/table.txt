A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows. A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows. Each row is identified by one or more values appearing in a particular column subset. The columns subset which uniquely identifies a row is called the primary key. The tables are then related to one another using foreign keys. A foreign key is simply the primary key in a different table.
The difference between tables and relations is that the table is usually a multiset of rows where the relation is a set which does not allow duplicates. Besides the actual data rows, tables generally have associated with them some metadata, such as constraints on the table or on the values within particular columns.
The data in a table does not have to be physically stored in the database. Views are also relational tables, but their data are calculated at query time.
