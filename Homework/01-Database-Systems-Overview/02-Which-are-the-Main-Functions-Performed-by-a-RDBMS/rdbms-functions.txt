RDBMS is a database management system based on relational model. It is used to manage the organization, storage, access, security and integrity of data. When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, the application system simply makes a "call" to the RDBMS. It stores information in a set of "tables", each of which has a unique identifier or "primary key". The tables are then related to one another using "foreign keys". A foreign key is simply the primary key in a different table. By storing data in a RDBMS, undesirable data redundancy can be avoided. This not only makes data management easier, but it also makes for a flexible database that can respond to changing requirements.

The main functions of the RDBMS are:
- Provides data to be stored in tables
- Persists data in the form of rows and columns
- Provides facility primary key, to uniquely identify the rows
- Creates indexes for quicker data retrieval
- Provides a virtual table creation in which sensitive data can be stored and simplified query can be applied.(views)
- Sharing a common column in two or more tables(primary key and foreign key)
- Provides multi user accessibility that can be controlled by individual users
